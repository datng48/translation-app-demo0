# Translator App

A Next.js application that provides translation and dictionary lookup features using OpenAI's API.

## Features

- Text translation between multiple languages
- Dictionary lookups with definitions and examples
- History of past lookups stored in a database

## Note 
- I've never tried leveraging the API key from LLM like OpenAI, so I think sometimes the production can have some cooldown to continue using, whereas in local don't have
- You may experience a cooldown like 4 - 10 seconds to able to use the production again.
